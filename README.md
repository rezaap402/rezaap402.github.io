# About

My name is **Reza Adhitama Putra Hernanda**, and I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Biosystems Engineering at Chungbuk National University, Republic of Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Hoonsoo Lee. My research focuses on nondestructive sensing for food safety and quality assurance, as well as plant phenotyping. I have worked with Vis–NIR, NIR, MIR, and Raman spectroscopy for chemical property prediction and seed viability discrimination, and I have also applied Vis–NIR and NIR hyperspectral imaging to detect adulteration in emerging food products. My current project explores abiotic stress detection using multispectral imaging, and I continue to maintain international research collaboration with my previous academic advisor, Dr. Hanim Zuhrotul Amanah ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=6G2X51gAAAAJ&hl=id&oi=ao)).
