# About

My name is Reza Adhitama Putra Hernanda and I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Biosystems Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Republic of Korea. My research interest is in nondestructive sensing for food safety and quality insurance and plant phenotyping. I have been working on Vis-NIR, NIR, MIR, and Raman spectroscopy for chemical properties prediction and seed viability discrimination, as well as the utilization of Vis-NIR and NIR hyperspectral imaging for adulteration detection in novel foods. My current research project is abiotic stress detection based on multispectral imaging and continuously maintaining an international collaboration with my previous academic advisor (Dr. Hanim Zuhrotul Amanah; https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?user=6G2X51gAAAAJ&hl=id&oi=ao).
